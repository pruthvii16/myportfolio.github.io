                <h3>Face Recognition Project</h3>
                <p>The Face Recognition project is like a smart computer that can recognize people's faces. 
                    It looks at unique things, like the distance between eyes, to figure out who someone is. 
                    This technology is often used for security, like unlocking phones. 
                    It's a cool way computers can recognize and know who you are!</p>
            </div>
            <div class="portfolio-item">
                <h3>Arduino Smart Dustbin Project</h3>
                <p>The Arduino Smart Dustbin is a clever project that uses a special sensor to open the dustbin lid automatically when you come near. 
                    This sensor, like magic, senses when you have some trash to throw away and opens the lid for you. 
                    It's like having a smart helper for keeping things clean. 
                    This project makes throwing away garbage easy and fun without even touching the dustbin lid!</p>
